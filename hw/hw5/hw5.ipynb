    "#### Different Potentials\n",
    "For warmup I though it would be nice to see a comparison between two different potentials. In the reference notebook we have both the harmonic and the double well potentials prepared, and so we can try them out both. Using Langevin thermostat with the initial settings, and using ```l=1.0``` in the case of the double well potential, we can obtain these graphs "

What we could try out next is to look at the difference between using a higher and a lower thermostat temperature. Specifically, using higher temperature should lead to bigger fluctuations in the energy. We will try out Langevin thermostat with the initial temperature ```T_init = 1.6```, and we will set the thermostat temperature to be either ```T = 0.2``` (left), or ```T = 3``` (right)."

On the left, we will use ```N = 5``` which is half the default, and then on the right we will change it to ```N=1000```.
